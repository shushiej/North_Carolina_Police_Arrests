# North_Carolina_Police_Arrests
This is a Data Visualisation project using North Carolina district data to understand poverty levels and arrests. 
This was part of a kaggle competiton https://www.kaggle.com/center-for-policing-equity/data-science-for-good.

I used this as a chance to cover basic visualisation techniques, and geoplotting using Shape files to understand the 
nature of arrests in North Carolina.
